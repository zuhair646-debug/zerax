# Zenrex Farm — PRD (Updated 2026-06-20)

## Problem Statement
Arabic-first AI builder for websites/apps/images/videos with credits-based pricing, Stripe payments, background-task persistence, and exportable codebase. Deployed on Hetzner VPS (zenrex.ai).

## Current Status — Healthy, Production Live ✅
- Domain: https://zenrex.ai
- Backend: Docker compose, MongoDB local
- Frontend: React PWA, Service Worker v9
- Stripe: Official `stripe` SDK with proxy support (no more emergentintegrations.payments dependency)

## Pricing (USD)
| Package | Price | Credits | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free signup | $0 | 200 | one-time bonus |
| **Ready Sites Trial** | **$9** | **500** | one-off (7 days) |
| **Ready Sites Purchase** | **$79** | **5,000** | one-off (full ownership) |
| Project Pack | $49 | 5,000 | one-off |
| Starter | $19/mo | 2,000 | subscription |
| Pro | $69/mo | 8,000 | subscription |
| Studio | $199/mo | 25,000 | subscription |

**Service costs (`SERVICE_COSTS`):** Image 100 / Video 10s 1,200 / Text 1k tokens 30 / Chat msg 10

## Architecture
### Triple-Layer Credit Guard
1. **Per-endpoint:** `pricing.credits.charge_user(service_key)` atomic deduction + ledger
2. **Backend Middleware:** `credits_guard.py` returns 402 on AI endpoints if `users.credits == 0`
3. **Frontend Global Toast:** `<GlobalCreditsGuard />` calm bottom-right pill on all AI/chat routes

### Stripe Integration (Independent)
- New shim: `/app/backend/modules/billing/stripe_shim.py` uses official `stripe==14.4.0` SDK
- Removed dependency on `emergentintegrations.payments.stripe`
- Auto-routes through Emergent's Stripe proxy if key starts with `sk_test_emergent`
- Works with real Stripe keys (sk_test_xxx or sk_live_xxx) for full independence

### Ready Sites Pay-First Flow (NEW)
1. User picks category → `/ready-sites/preview/{id}`
2. Clicks "Continue" → `/ready-sites/purchase?category=X`
3. Chooses Trial ($9) or Purchase ($79)
4. **Redirected to Stripe Checkout** (USD)
5. After payment → success URL `/billing/success?session_id=…`
6. Billing webhook AUTO-CREATES the FreeBuild project with category context
7. BillingSuccess page polls status, gets `project_id` field, redirects to `/freebuild/chat/{id}?source=ready-sites`
8. User lands in chat with AI greeting asking for store name + logo

## Recent Completed Work (2026-06-20 → 2026-06-21 session)
- Hero Z logo removed | `/pricing` loads PricingV2 | Stripe import made lazy
- **Credits pivot:** PACKAGES simplified, deduction unified, `/generate/video` fixed
- **3-layer guard:** middleware + per-endpoint charge + global toast
- **Calm UI banners:** smaller pill-style, single tap to /pricing
- **Ready Sites paywall:** PayPal + LemonSqueezy (Stripe fully removed)
- **End-to-end verified:** signup→200 credits, Ready Sites checkout returns real PayPal URL on prod
- **🆕 FreeBuild streaming agent now deducts credits per turn** — fixed root cause of "credits not deducting" complaint. The `/api/freebuild/project/{pid}/agent-chat-stream` SSE endpoint was the main builder chat but had ZERO `record_usage()` calls. Added token accumulation from Claude's `final_msg.usage` and one `record_usage()` call per turn before the `done` event.
- **🆕 Removed all role-based credit bypasses** — owner/admin/super_admin/`is_owner=true` no longer skip credit deduction. Every account, regardless of role, deducts credits for AI usage from `users.credits`. Modified: `pricing/credits.py:charge_user`, `ai_core/usage_meter.py:check_quota` + `/usage/credits`, `middleware/credits_guard.py`, `ai_core/__init__.py:_get_user_tier`.
- **🆕 Removed leftover preview-env asset links** from static HTML files: `final-preview.html`, `iframe-test.html`, `user-crop-preview.html` (all referenced `ai-cinematic-hub-2.preview.emergentagent.com` for background images).
